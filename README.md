# Job-Shop Scheduling Problem

## 1. Description

In the classical Job-Shop problem there are _n_ jobs that must be processed on _m_ machines. Each job consists of a sequence of different tasks _(operations)_. Each task needs to be processed during an _uninterrupted_ period of time on a given machine.

Given a set _J_ of jobs, a set _M_ of machines and a set _T_ of tasks, we denote by _τ<sub>j</sub>_ the number of tasks for a given job _j_ ∈ _J_. To each task _a<sub>ij</sub>_ corresponds an ordered pair _(m<sub>ij</sub>, p<sub>ij</sub>)_: the task _a<sub>ij</sub>_ needs to be processed on machine _m<sub>ij</sub>_ ∈ _M_ for a period of _p<sub>ij</sub>_ units of time.
